# WASD Scroller for Chrome

A simple Chrome extension that lets you scroll web pages using the WASD keys. Perfect for developers and readers who prefer keyboard navigation over using the mouse or arrow keys. Inspired by a similar Firefox extension, this tool brings the same convenience to Chrome.

> It automatically ignores when text input fields are focused, allowing you to type without interruption ('input', 'textarea', 'select'). 

> CTRL + SHIFT + W for toggle enable/disable.

## Features
- **W**: Scroll up
- **S**: Scroll down
- **A**: Page Up

I wanted a better way to scroll through documentation and web pages without lifting my left hand to use the arrow keys or mouse. WASD navigation is faster and more comfortable for me.
